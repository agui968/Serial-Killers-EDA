## Serial Killers EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

### Overview
This repository contains an EDA project focused on exploring the determinants of serial killers' behavior. The analysis primarily investigates the impact of the environment on serial killers, with a specific focus on:

+ Place of origin
+ Number of victims
+ Population density
+ Poverty rate

#### Hypotheses:
This analysis is driven by several hypotheses:

1. This analysis aims to identify **countries with the highest number of serial killings and killers**.

2. It will also try to confirm whether they often originate from or are prevalent in low socio-economic environments.
3.  Moreover, it will study if serial killers tend to emerge in regions with high population density.

4. The prevailing clich√© is that serial killers are more common in America and Europe; however, this analysis questions whether this is due to **biases in cultural representation** or if these regions indeed have a higher prevalence.

5. Lastly, the analysis will also try to determine which **countries discover serial killers earlier**.

### Data Sources

The analysis uses datasets containing information on serial killers, their place of origin, population density, and poverty rates. The data sources are collected from:

+ [Four Kaggle datasets on the topic](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vesuvius13/serial-killers-dataset/data)
+ [Population density dataset from Data World](https://data.world/samayo/country-names/workspace/file?filename=country-population-density.json)
+ [Poverty rate dataset from OECD Data](https://data.oecd.org/inequality/poverty-rate.htm)

You will find them in the *data* folder.

#### Code and Notebooks

+ The code for this analysis is available in the *notebooks* folder, where you can follow the step-by-step exploration and visualization of the data.

+ You will also find a *utils* folder with several csv files and material I created to support my EDA.

+ If you want to read an overview of the project, go to the *memo.ipynb* file.
